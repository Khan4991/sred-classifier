Description: Update the OS of Casa from  Rel 7.2.5, Ver 2,build63a1 to Rel 8.2.5, Ver 1,build77c1

This new OS code contains a critical update to address the  P1 outage  under IMT.1906.033710 which affected all Casa CMTS that are running the current code  Rel 7.2.5, Ver 2,build63a1. 

The new OS code contain a software enhancement  to support BGP decoding and processing of BGP update packets in cases when a bad attribute length is received by BGP which could result in interrupted connectivity with BGP peers. The enhancement ensures normal handling of BGP update packets to mitigate possible connectivity issues with peer routers.

The purpose of updating  cmts76.grnsbr is to test this new OS code for stability before rolling it out to the entire network.",No Issues,CMTS,P1,1

Current IOS-XR version 6.1.4 is EoL, to keep the routers in maintenance and keeping getting SMUs for any software bugs the routers will be upgraded to 6.5.3. This upgrade will also address some bugs on 6.1.x release like rebooting of standby RPs.

Description: 2.2 Scope of Work (NCT ? Description)
This MOP covers the portion to complete common core phase 9 which is to migrate WPRs and MXs from wireless AS20453 to Rogers Cable AS812. This will be done by direct peering these nodes to RCIN RRs. In the existig setup, there are peerings between wireless and RCIN RRs at 2 locations (slnt and MLO2). AS number on these nodes will be changed to 812. This emop covers steps to migrate MLO2WPR01/02, MLO2WEC01/2 and MLO2GTPFW01.
Business Drive:
This is the 9th phase towards the Common Core initiative and if not completed will have a trickling effect on the remainder of the common core activities, and also coming 2nd SGi , R4B expansion projects.

Rollback of this activity to change peering of wireless nodes back with wireless RRs (AS 20453).",No Issues,WPR,P2,0

Description: 2.2 Scope of Work (NCT ? Description)
To reduce the number of prefixes to be advertised to RRs (and to the network) from any PHUB, Engineering has decided to use aggregate routes command on DGWs. This will replace existing configuration where prefixes are statically defined and are distribute into BGP to be advertised out to RRs and to the network. This will reduce the configuration size in DGWs.
Engineering has also defined new Regional communities. These communities will be added in DGWs. Though routing to the internet will still use old communities. New communities will start working once these are configured on IGWs next year. Old communities will be removed from the network (DGWs/CGWs and IGWs) afterwards.
This MOP will take care of site ORLV. Following nodes will be worked on:
