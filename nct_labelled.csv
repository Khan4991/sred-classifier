This new OS code contains a critical update to address the  P1 outage  under IMT.1906.033710 which affected all Casa CMTS that are running the current code  Rel 7.2.5, Ver 2,build63a1. 

The new OS code contain a software enhancement  to support BGP decoding and processing of BGP update packets in cases when a bad attribute length is received by BGP which could result in interrupted connectivity with BGP peers. The enhancement ensures normal handling of BGP update packets to mitigate possible connectivity issues with peer routers.
